                    2021 was the first time Jonas made it to the Tour de France with Jumbo-Visma. After the teams leader Primoz-roglic suffered a bad crash, Jonas was put into the position of leader. He took the most of this opportunity and finished second overall to Tadej pogacar.

                    2022 was a big year for Jonas and Jumbo-Visma. Together they won the 2022 addition of the Tour de France. Before the tour, Jonas had many victories in smaller stage races asserting his dominance over his soon to be competition in the Tour de France.

                   In 2023 Jonas won the Tour for a second year in a row by an even larger margin than his first victory. During the finall TT of the race Jonas was able to have one of the best rides of his life and put largley significant amounts of time into his closest competitiors. Thanks to this sucessful TT and the help of his team, Jonas was able to defeat his beggest rival, Tadej Pogacar, once again.
